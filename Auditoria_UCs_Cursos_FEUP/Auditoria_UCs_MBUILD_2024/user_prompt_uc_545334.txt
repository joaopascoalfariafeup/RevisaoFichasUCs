## Objetivos
Every year a couple of thousand people die through fires in countries of the European Union. Furthermore, some ten thousand people are heavily injured. Besides the damage to persons the damages concerning buildings account for billions.<br />Against this background, fire protection is an important part of sustainability, both in what concerns the effect of fire in CO2 emissions (in the accident itself and in the subsequent refurbishing need), as well in the impact, concerning increased risk of fire, of design options mainly specified under sustainable perspectives. <br />Fire protection is an inherent part in the bachelor study programme of architects and civil engineers. Within this master course this knowledge is deepened and is put on a more scientific<br />&#9830;Possess and understand knowledge that provides a basis or opportunity to be original in the development and/or application of ideas, often in a research context;<br />&#9830;Students are able to apply their acquired knowledge and problem-solving skills in new or unfamiliar environments within broader (or multidisciplinary) contexts related to their area of study.<br />&#9830;Students are able to integrate knowledge and deal with the complexity of making judgments based on information that is incomplete or limited, including reflections on the social and ethical responsibilities associated with applying their knowledge and judgments.<br />&#9830;Students are able to communicate their findings and the ultimate knowledge and reasons behind them to specialist and non-specialist audiences in a clear and unambiguous manner.<br />&#9830;Students possess the learning skills to enable them to continue studying in a largely self-directed or autonomous manner.

## Melhoria de classificação
&#9830;No minimum grade is required in each specific exercise/coursework or in each block. If the final grade of the module is FAILED, then the student will choose a certain number of exercises/courseworks with the lowest grades of any block to resubmit them in order to increase the final grade of the module to obtain a PASS. In those cases where the original exercise/workshop was submitted in group or in pairs, the new submission will be carried out individually; in those cases, lecturer will adapt the exercise to accommodate the working effort for an individual submission.<br />&#9830;Deadline of the re-submission will be done, as latest, during the official resit period of the semester at THM.
