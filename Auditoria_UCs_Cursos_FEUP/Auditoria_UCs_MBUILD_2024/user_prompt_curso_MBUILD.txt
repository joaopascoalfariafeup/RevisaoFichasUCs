First edition will begin in the academic year 2022/2023 (1
st
semester in FEUP);
All course will be taught in English.
Background
The background of this course lies in the MSc in European Construction Engineering (MSECE) that has run for more than 20 years during which a deep and valuable partnership has developed between a wide range of European HEI – from Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Denmark - providing remarkable and invaluable contacts, knowledge exchange and partnership between teachers and students alike.
Among the current partners, FEUP (Portugal), Universidad de Cantabria (Spain) and THM Giessen (Germany), have decided to develop a new course, making good use of the existing cooperation and expertise among them and, on the other hand, developing a framework for the course’s curricula that includes new and updated subjects and provides a larger transversal/European approach for issues pertaining to the Construction Industry.
In the Construction Industry, although always with a large weight of domestic business, its larger and more prestigious companies have, for long, included an important slice of their business in non-European countries. The projects developed in many of these target countries rely on know-how and expertise brought by those companies which are faced, often, by some difficulty in finding local specialist collaborators with enough knowledge and skills that would enable them to understand the scope and innovation of the technical approaches to be implemented, and be an efficient bridge between the contracting company and the local manpower and services suppliers.
For this purpose, three European HEI have collaborated - FEUP (Portugal), Universidad de Cantabria (Spain) and THM Giessen (Germany) – and developed a framework for the course’s curricula with relevant subjects under the present Sustainability concerns and providing a large transversal/European approach for these issues as pertaining to the Construction Industry.
Objetivos
General Objectives for the Course
The attained of final products in the Construction Industry business area (buildings, infrastructures) requires the linking of a wide number of different professional expertise and environments, each with their own specific technical approaches and constraints, as well as different work languages. The implementation of sustainable concepts and solutions, through all the production cycle, requires a comprehensive and transversally spanning knowledge of the various issues at hand, as well as the capability to use management, development and control tools that may bring the several inputs into play in proper time and in adequate detail, so that the final output may be the best possible sum of each team member’s contribution.
Therefore, the students enrolling this course are expected to attain the following outcomes in four areas:
SS
Sustainable Strategies
– to be acquainted and understand the several concepts and approaches towards the fulfilment the SDG in CI, including the use of existing tools for the assessment of performance under sustainability;
SD
Sustainable Design
– to understand the requirements and be able to develop design solutions that balance the necessities of the several expertise involved as considered under sustainable attitudes; to be able to access and use 3-7D BIM models;
SC
Sustainable Construction
– to be aware of the constraints arising from the implementation of sustainable buildings and infrastructures, both in the choice of materials and execution methods; to understand and be able to apply existing methodologies for its appraisal, under technical and economic aspects.
SM
Sustainable Management
– understand and use work approaches that foster the implementation of sustainable coordinated options under the diverse expertise; apply Integrated Project Development models and ICT technologies for an effective information flow and monitoring.
Áreas de Especialização
Organization Framework
The proposed
MBUILD
MSc in Sustainable Design, Construction and Management of the Built Environment
is a 2-year Cycle of Studies awarding the degree of Master of Science.
The course is organised in three teaching semesters, each one taking place in one of the partner universities, with an identical study plan to all students. These will travel between the three universities with classes delivered mainly by the residing staff and collaboration from staff from the other partners.
The 1
st
semester, to be delivered in FEUP (Portugal), focus on getting the students into the frame of mind of how to develop work in the CI under SUSTAINABILITY concerns. For this, the proposed modules will address the main CONCEPTS and STRATEGIES for Sustainability and how these can be implemented during the development of multi-expertise BUILDING DESIGN. The wide scope of stakeholders, professional expertise and trades that have to be combined during the full production spectrum for a building or infrastructure will be covered in modules concerning the MANAGEMENT of PROJECTS (inception and design focused) and WORKS (execution focused). In these modules the issues pertaining to the coordination and integration of the various components and the tools that can be used to structure, develop and monitor them, will be addressed. Finally, a module of INTEGRATED PROJECT 1 will apply most of these concepts and approaches in a practical case-study directed to building design.
The 2
nd
semester, to be delivered in THM (Germany), will address the issues concerned with the tools for the assessment of the performance of SUSTAINABLE CITIES and BUILDINGS, both new and refurbished, as well as the issues related to the achievement of a SUSTAINABLE THERMAL and ACOUSTIC LIVING ENVIRONMENT. A FIRE PROTECTION module will address the issues yielding from situations with large number of people gather in confined spaces, where the technical and materials’ problems arising from increased living comfort will also be relevant. The dematerialization of information in the CI, the computer tools for 3D-to-7D construction modelling will be the focus in ICT and BIM, with a large attention for an efficient management of the information contents and flow. As in the 1
st
semester, a INTEGRATED PROJECT 2 will take place, now concerned essentially with the urban impact of building design.
The 3
rd
semester, now in UC (Spain), will concentrate largely on the aspects related to SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURES and SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, addressing the role of the urban context and how to ensure that sustainability concerns are adequately accounted for in it. The SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS and TECHNIQUES in CI will also be in focus, balancing the aspects of resource conservation and the economic short and long term impact of choices made during the design and execution stage. As a support for the development of the dissertation, the module of NEW TRENDS IN R&D in the Construction Industry will address the diverse areas under development for the future of a more sustainable industry and built environment. The INTEGRATED PROJECT 3 module will make use of the results of the two previous ones and frame it under the needed skills of entrepreneurship, leadership, adaptive and proactive professional profile, highly demanded for multinational CI companies.
The 4th semester will be devoted to the development of the Dissertation and will take place in ANY OF THE UNIVERSITIES, according to theme and supervisor chosen by each student.

## Ano: 1
## Semestre: 1
## ECTS: 6.0
## Objetivos: <p>The objective of this module is the development of a <strong>CONCEPT PROPOSAL FOR A MODULAR HOUSING SYSTEM</strong> that may be implemented throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Housing is one of the greatest problems that several European communities have been facing.  Among others, the widening of non-traditional tourist accommodation demand (Airbnb, etc.), digital nomads with high purchasing power and investment ventures driven by &#8211; mainly - non-EU citizens with large financial resources, has placed a heavy pressure on the existing housing markets, both new and refurbished. This, associated with the lack of in-time supply from the part of the industry, has driven prices up, equally for the purchase and rental market, with a large inability of the governments to give an adequate response for matching their citizen&#8217;s economic capability with the current market prices of the properties.</p>
<p>Some construction companies have been devoting a lot of effort to research and investment into two relatively recent approaches, aiming at increasing production and providing the market with suitable response under a reasonable timeframe: offsite production and modular construction.</p>
<p>For this module, the students are challenged to develop and present a <strong>Proposal For a Modular Housing System, at Concept Level</strong>, that may be applied in various European countries, therefore possible to adapt to each one&#8217;s national code requirements and social preferences.</p>

## Resultados de aprendizagem: <ul><br /><li>Develop a comprehensive research on one of the several influencing factors for the objective at hand;</li><br /><li>Present the research to the class, in a way possible to be understood and incorporate in each group&#8217;s individual part of the project;</li><br /><li>Be able to define and organise input-output stages of development of work and contribute for its gathering into a single proposal.</li><br /></ul>

# Unidade curricular: Dissertação (U.Porto / THM / UC)

## Ano: 2
## Semestre: 2
## ECTS: 30.0
## Objetivos: <div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>The contents are intended to complement the teaching in the scientific area of the program, allowing the student to choose the development of a more in-depth work. Therefore, the Final Master's Work can acquire the profile of a traditional academic research, in which current topics will be proposed, integrated in topics that have received special attention from the national and international scientific community, tending to the proposal of the resolution of a specific problem or the presentation of relevant advances for its study and better understanding. In the same way, the work can have a profile more connected to the resolution of a specific operational situation (if possible, proposed by a company), in which the solution will have to be framed in a deep investigation that includes the state of the art, relevant scientific principles and validation of the proposals. These possibilities will have the tutors and moderators indicated by the participating institutions, depending on the scope of the work to be done. The control of the activities will be done through regular meetings, attended by the student and an assigned tutor(s) and moderator(s). As this is the module that culminates the academic career of the program's students, we seek to ensure that emerging professionals are highly qualified, possessing knowledge, skills and competencies that they will need in their area of work. Therefore, these professionals should be able to solve challenges and problems in a structured way, assume multidisciplinary issues from the main scientific areas that are related to the construction industry, placing them in their respective technical, scientific, economic, social and environmental contexts. They will also be able to logically communicate the results of their work to the technical community and to society in general, having improved their leadership, entrepreneurial and teamwork skills, taking into account the economic contexts and international competitiveness.</div>

## ECTS: 6.0
## Objetivos: Every year a couple of thousand people die through fires in countries of the European Union. Furthermore, some ten thousand people are heavily injured. Besides the damage to persons the damages concerning buildings account for billions.<br />Against this background, fire protection is an important part of sustainability, both in what concerns the effect of fire in CO2 emissions (in the accident itself and in the subsequent refurbishing need), as well in the impact, concerning increased risk of fire, of design options mainly specified under sustainable perspectives. <br />Fire protection is an inherent part in the bachelor study programme of architects and civil engineers. Within this master course this knowledge is deepened and is put on a more scientific<br />&#9830;Possess and understand knowledge that provides a basis or opportunity to be original in the development and/or application of ideas, often in a research context;<br />&#9830;Students are able to apply their acquired knowledge and problem-solving skills in new or unfamiliar environments within broader (or multidisciplinary) contexts related to their area of study.<br />&#9830;Students are able to integrate knowledge and deal with the complexity of making judgments based on information that is incomplete or limited, including reflections on the social and ethical responsibilities associated with applying their knowledge and judgments.<br />&#9830;Students are able to communicate their findings and the ultimate knowledge and reasons behind them to specialist and non-specialist audiences in a clear and unambiguous manner.<br />&#9830;Students possess the learning skills to enable them to continue studying in a largely self-directed or autonomous manner.
