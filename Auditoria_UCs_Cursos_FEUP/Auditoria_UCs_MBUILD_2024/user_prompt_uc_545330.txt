## Objetivos
<p>The objective of this module is the development of a <strong>CONCEPT PROPOSAL FOR A MODULAR HOUSING SYSTEM</strong> that may be implemented throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Housing is one of the greatest problems that several European communities have been facing.  Among others, the widening of non-traditional tourist accommodation demand (Airbnb, etc.), digital nomads with high purchasing power and investment ventures driven by &#8211; mainly - non-EU citizens with large financial resources, has placed a heavy pressure on the existing housing markets, both new and refurbished. This, associated with the lack of in-time supply from the part of the industry, has driven prices up, equally for the purchase and rental market, with a large inability of the governments to give an adequate response for matching their citizen&#8217;s economic capability with the current market prices of the properties.</p>
<p>Some construction companies have been devoting a lot of effort to research and investment into two relatively recent approaches, aiming at increasing production and providing the market with suitable response under a reasonable timeframe: offsite production and modular construction.</p>
<p>For this module, the students are challenged to develop and present a <strong>Proposal For a Modular Housing System, at Concept Level</strong>, that may be applied in various European countries, therefore possible to adapt to each one&#8217;s national code requirements and social preferences.</p>

## Resultados de aprendizagem e competências
<ul><br /><li>Develop a comprehensive research on one of the several influencing factors for the objective at hand;</li><br /><li>Present the research to the class, in a way possible to be understood and incorporate in each group&#8217;s individual part of the project;</li><br /><li>Be able to define and organise input-output stages of development of work and contribute for its gathering into a single proposal.</li><br /></ul>

## Pré-requisitos e co-requisitos
Basic knowledge about sustainable concepts in design, construction and managements of buildings and infrastructures.

## Programa
<p>For tackling with this challenge, the class was divided into 5 groups (architects and engineers in each), and the work was decided to be carried by means of the strategy described below.</p>
<p><strong>3.1. Stage 1 - Diagnosis &#8211; Housing in Europe</strong></p>
<p>Development of a detailed analysis of the current and vernacular state of the art in housing construction in Europe, addressing the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate Patterns</strong> - Temperature, Precipitation, Solar Light, Snow, Wind, Earthquake, Topography;</li>
<li><strong>Climate Studies </strong>&#8211; Current Situation, Adapted Vernacular Solutions, Projections for the future;</li>
<li><strong>Housing in Europe</strong> &#8211; Availability, Type, Economic Trends and Wages, Employment;</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Strategies</strong> &#8211; Bioclimatic, Smart Use of Space, Materials, Renewable Energies, PassiveHaus;</li>
<li><strong>Codes and Regulations</strong> &#8211; Thermal, Daylight, Ventilation, Areas and Dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these items, a group compiled the findings into an easy-to-use system, including the results, technical schemes and references, so that the global class group will have access to all data and information and carry on to the next stage.</p>
<p>This stage is finished and was developed during the first part of the semester. Its outcomes were presented to the class in the first week of December.</p>
<p><strong>3.2. Stage 2 &#8211; Concept Proposal for a Highly Adaptable Housing Module</strong></p>
<p>After the previous Diagnosis &#8211; in fact, a wide-ranging State-of-the-Art - of what will have to be considered and what good ideas can one learn from our ancestors &#8211; the class group will develop a Concept Proposal for a Housing Module that will aim to comply with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housing Spaces&#8217; Types and Areas </strong>&#8211; adaptable to the largest number of code and/or social requirements; as an orientation, the Base Module (or associated multiples of it) must be able to provide a dwelling with <strong>Living Room + Kitchen + Bathroom + 1 bedroom</strong>. The same Base Module must be able to be used for increasing the size of the dwelling for up to 3-4 Bedrooms and extra 1&#8209;2 Bathrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Structure </strong>&#8211; flexible for 2D or 3D offsite construction and taking into account the conditions for transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency </strong>&#8211; module envelope observing the required code parameters, using a solution that may be easily adjusted to their variation.</li>
<li><strong>Water Efficiency </strong>&#8211; solutions with low water consumption and recycling/reuse of greywater and/or rainwater.</li>
<li><strong>Materials </strong>&#8211; concentrating in materials with low carbon footprint and high potential for reuse.</li>
<li><strong>Production and Assembly</strong> &#8211; proposed strategy for the assembly of elements, both under a 2D or a 3D approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Proposal will be described by means of the <strong>Deliverables </strong>to be defined in the planning of the module. As this is a <strong>CONCEPT Proposal</strong>, no detailed calculations are required; nevertheless, some pre-dimensioning should be performed so that, for instance, the type and dimensions of the main structural elements or the width of external walls and roofs, may be represented under a reasonable basis, to be further analysed and detailed in the next IP modules.</p>
