## Objetivos
Sustainability in Building Design will try to guide the students through the several main expertise in the development of a sustainable building design proposal and, for each, provide a set of reflection/analysis/exploration routes that may help the students to find technical answers that will enable them to propose sustainable and integrated solutions for the context of a specific project.

## Pré-requisitos e co-requisitos
Basic knowledge about sustainable concepts in design, construction and managements of buildings and infrastructures.

## Programa
<ol><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable Building Design (SBD) Framework</strong>: What is to think &#8220;Sustainable&#8221;. How does a comprehensive design happen? Who is involved and what types of arrangement between stakeholders can exist, and what impact do they have on a sustainable outcome. Definitions; beyond energy and materials; social and physical communities.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable Architectural Space Design</strong>: What makes a space sustainable in its use as a place to develop activities? What guidelines a designer should follow to achieve such spaces? How can an architect assess several design options? Designing for long-term use; housing and distance-working; use of space and of external areas; private vs. communal facilities; impact of decisions on materials and technical systems; designing with focus on less waste and higher reuse potential.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable Structural Design</strong>: What makes a structure sustainable in its use in time and in its integration with the other expertise? How the several types of structural concepts accommodate the goal of sustainability? What materials can be used and how do they perform in that respect. Member locations and dimensions, and their impact on future evolutions. How important is disassembly, recycling and reuse in the field of structural elements? What technologies exist for this purpose? Strength ability and member dimensions; impact of protruding elements on future rearrangement of spaces; reuse of structural materials; information about member load bearing capacity.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable Water Supply and Drainage Design</strong>: What are the sustainable approaches for the supply and the recovery of water? What are today&#8217;s water supply requirements, and what equipment exists that is adjusted to those requirements. How to develop piping arrangement with installation focused on offsite assembly? How can rainwater extremes be accommodated in building design? What architectural constraints result from the collection and use of rainwater? Availability of water resources and their impact on building fixtures design; appliances for low water debit; extreme weather and public networks; reuse of rainwater; wastewater treatment and reuse of output.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable Energy Conservation Design</strong>: Materials and strategies for insulation and its impact on the overall physical dimensions of the building. Balancing insulation with ventilation. Approaches for cold and warmer countries and its impact of building inception. Technologies, requirements and constraints for energy production and use at the scale of a building. Strategies for heat and cold environments; shading and inertia; renewable energy harvesting in buildings.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable Urban Environment Design</strong>: How does the placement and dimensions of a building impact sustainability? How does the urban modelling, at the level of quarter and city, produces impact on sustainability? The core topics include the quality of the stay of people visiting the outdoor public space. That quality is driven by the microclimate and the ability of climate adaptation and resilience, overheating prevention through vegetation and water combined - with the options to communicate with other people in the exterior as well as the interior spaces. Biodiversity strategies can support the quality of outdoor areas. Also particular focus is dedicated to the promotion of local natural energy potentials and a possible interaction with mobility: The connection with the environment is strengthened and mobility management strategies for car-free districts are rewarded.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Reversible States and Tectonics</strong>: The planet is no longer stable and climate is changing. This together with scarcity in materials and resources, is a challenge in the way we built today. We are still today using resources, in ways that leads to exploitation and exhaustion of our landscapes.  We need to know the these &#8220;new&#8221; landscapes and how we create living nature instead of ruins. We need accept equal dependencies, human and non-human &#8211; we are all part of the same fluid nature. States indicate that materials, landscapes, cities are in different states and we need to learn about materials and resources (nature), in order to apply circular processes or reversibility. (We will visit plantation and quarry) Buildings come from nature, we therefor need to know the value of our common resources and materials and how to make sure they can go back and become nature again or being used again and again. Designing for &#8220;reversibility&#8221; demands a rethinking of our design approach. We will explore designs within reversible tectonics, including materials lifecycle to understand where our resources and materials are coming from but also how we design in a reversible way &#8211; meaning how do we plan and design for cities, buildings or materials to be reused when it&#8217;s current state become obsolete.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Sustainable production of buildings</strong>: materials, modularity, offsite construction; sub-contracting, wages and workmanship rotation; productivity in the CI.</li><br /><li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;><strong>Overview</strong>: relevance and application in diverse countries; balancing short-term needs and sustainable approaches.</li><br /></ol>
