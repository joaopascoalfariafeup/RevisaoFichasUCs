## Objetivos
<div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>The contents are intended to complement the teaching in the scientific area of the program, allowing the student to choose the development of a more in-depth work. Therefore, the Final Master's Work can acquire the profile of a traditional academic research, in which current topics will be proposed, integrated in topics that have received special attention from the national and international scientific community, tending to the proposal of the resolution of a specific problem or the presentation of relevant advances for its study and better understanding. In the same way, the work can have a profile more connected to the resolution of a specific operational situation (if possible, proposed by a company), in which the solution will have to be framed in a deep investigation that includes the state of the art, relevant scientific principles and validation of the proposals. These possibilities will have the tutors and moderators indicated by the participating institutions, depending on the scope of the work to be done. The control of the activities will be done through regular meetings, attended by the student and an assigned tutor(s) and moderator(s). As this is the module that culminates the academic career of the program's students, we seek to ensure that emerging professionals are highly qualified, possessing knowledge, skills and competencies that they will need in their area of work. Therefore, these professionals should be able to solve challenges and problems in a structured way, assume multidisciplinary issues from the main scientific areas that are related to the construction industry, placing them in their respective technical, scientific, economic, social and environmental contexts. They will also be able to logically communicate the results of their work to the technical community and to society in general, having improved their leadership, entrepreneurial and teamwork skills, taking into account the economic contexts and international competitiveness.</div>
