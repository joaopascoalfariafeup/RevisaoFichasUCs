## Objetivos
<ul><br /><li>The main goal of this module is that the student learns the relevance of Sustainability of Infrastructures along their useful life, not only during design and construction, but also during the exploitation period.</li><br /><li>The students will learn the main aspects related to infrastructures maintenance and exploitation.</li><br /><li>Besides, they will learn the importance of applying environmental rating systems during the design and construction, in order to get the optimum cycle of circular economy. Finally, the students will learn the aspect related to sustainable mobility in cities, what will ensure their more rational use.</li><br /></ul>
