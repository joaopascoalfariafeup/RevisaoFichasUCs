## Objetivos
<p>Today construction projects are more complex and sophisticated than in the past. Due to an extreme heterogeneous network in construction projects, deadline pressure, last minute changes and missing communication between all parties involved construction projects running out of time and cost.</p>
<p>With the application of 4D and 5D BIM process, engineers and architects are able to forecast time and costs before construction begins. Furthermore, the usage of parameters for sustainability (6D), as for thermal and acoustic comfort, allows important decision in a construction project in a very early phase. This eases the quality of the project and meet clients&#8217; requirements. </p>
<ul>
<li>Possess and understand knowledge that provides a basis or opportunity to be original in the development and/or application of ideas, often in a research context.</li>
<li>Students are able to apply their acquired knowledge and problem-solving skills in new or unfamiliar environments within broader (or multidisciplinary) contexts related to their area of study.</li>
<li>Students are able to integrate knowledge and deal with the complexity of making judgments based on information that is incomplete or limited, including reflections on the social and ethical responsibilities associated with applying their knowledge and judgments.</li>
<li>Students are able to communicate their findings and the ultimate knowledge and reasons behind them to specialist and non-specialist audiences in a clear and unambiguous manner.</li>
<li>Students possess the learning skills to enable them to continue studying in a largely self-directed or autonomous manner.</li>

<ul><br /><li>No minimum grade is required in each specific exercise/coursework or in each block. If the final grade of the module is FAILED, then the student will choose a certain number of exercises/courseworks with the lowest grades of any block to resubmit them in order to increase the final grade of the module to obtain a PASS. In those cases where the original exercise/workshop was submitted in group or in pairs, the new submission will be carried out individually; in those cases, lecturer will adapt the exercise to accommodate the working effort for an individual submission.</li><br /><li>Deadline of the re-submission will be done, as latest, during the official resit period of the semester at THM.</li><br /></ul>
