## Resultados de aprendizagem e competências
<p>People often think about &#8220;marketing&#8221; strictly as advertising &#8212; a highly visible activity by which organizations try to persuade customers to buy products and services. However, marketing is much more than advertising alone; even the most skilful marketer cannot make customers buy things that they don't want. In this course students will acquire skills and competencies to make and defend marketing decisions in the context of real-world problem situations with incomplete information (case studies and simulations) and make cross-functional connections between marketing and other business areas. The skills acquired will be useful regardless of the industry.</p>

<li>Understand the concept of marketing and its relationship with other business disciplines. Discuss and develop a framework to understand ethics implications on marketing</li>
<li>Rigorous analysis of the customers, competitors, and the overall business environment, which are the key activities of marketing management.

<li>Make sound decisions pertaining to Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning</li>
<li>Identifying customer needs and satisfying these needs with the right product and/or service</li>
<li>Go to Market Strategy to introduce new products in the marketing dealing with time and with product maturity</li>
<li>Develop branding concepts and identify the major steps in creating and developing a brand and brand equity</li>
<li>Assuring availability to customers through the best distribution channels,</li>
