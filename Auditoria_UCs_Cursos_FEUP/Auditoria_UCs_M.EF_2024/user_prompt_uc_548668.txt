## Métodos de ensino e atividades de aprendizagem
Classes based on interactive discussion of the theoretical concepts, with relevant examples and problem solving.<br /><br />Hands-on activities and demonstrations (computational and experimental).<br /><br />Visits to laboratories in order to understand relevant experiments ongoing on the research labs.

## Tipo de avaliação
Avaliação distribuída com exame final

## Componentes de Avaliação
- Exame: 60.0 %
- Trabalho escrito: 40.0 %

## Componentes de Ocupação
- Estudo autónomo: 120.0 horas
- Frequência das aulas: 42.0 horas

## Fórmula de cálculo da classificação final
All students must take the final exam.<br /><br />Sudents can choose to be assessed only based on the final exam, in which case the exam grade is the final grade.<br /><br />An optional written report can be considered for 40% of the grade. In this case, the final grade is computed as:<br /><br /><div>    Final = 0.6×E + 0.4×R (E: exam, R: report)</div>
