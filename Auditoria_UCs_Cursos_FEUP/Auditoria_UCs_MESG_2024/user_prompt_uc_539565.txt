## Resultados de aprendizagem e competências
<p>After the completion of this course unit, students should be able to: a - Describe and explain the context that supports the development of new models and business processes supported by information and communication technologies. b - Explain the benefits of process- oriented organizations management and describe the regulatory frameworks and models of reference. c - Identify and design the processes of an organization from its business model. d - List, explain and apply the main methods, techniques and support tools to the modeling and analysis of processes in an organization. e - Specify information systems to support the implementation and management of business processes from their models.</p>

## Programa
<p>I- Concepts and principles; Models and processes: framework and strategy; II- Process-oriented management systems; Business Models and Business Processes; III- Identification and modelation of processes and services; Representation methods and process documentation; Application examples; &#8220;as-is&#8221; and &#8220;to be&#8221; models; IV- Specification of information systems which support process and services management; V- Process management: models, techniques and tools; Alignment, and Performance improvement and management.</p>

## Métodos de ensino e atividades de aprendizagem
<p>- Theoretical classes: presentation of course unit themes along with the presentation and discussion of real practical applications. -Extra classes: a)Regular execution of limited complexity individual assignments related to course unit themes. b) Execution of a project of analysis and design of an organisation business process and specification of the corresponding information systems of support. The project is a teamwork assignment of medium/high complexity.</p>

## Tipo de avaliação
Avaliação distribuída com exame final

## Componentes de Avaliação
- Trabalho prático ou de projeto: 45.0 %
- Participação presencial: 20.0 %
- Exame: 35.0 %

## Componentes de Ocupação
- Elaboração de projeto: 56.0 horas
- Estudo autónomo: 28.0 horas
- Frequência das aulas: 42.0 horas
- Trabalho escrito: 30.0 horas

## Fórmula de cálculo da classificação final
Final Grade = 0.35 * exam + 0.45 project (group work) + 0.20 participation<br /><br />In the assessment of each group work, the following components will be taken into account:- appreciation by the teachers of the work carried out by the group<br /><br />- appreciation of the individual performance of each student by the peers<br /><br />- appreciation by the teachers of the individual performance of each student<br /><br />The approval in the course also presupposes the following minimum grades:<br /><br />- exam: minimum 40%<br />- group work: minimum 40%<br /><br />If there is a difference over 4 points (on a scale of 0 to 20) in the grade on the exam vs the grades on the group work, the upper grade will be reduced so that the difference stays at 4 points.<br /><br />In the exam of appeal, the weights used in calculating the final classification are identical to those of the regular exam period.

## Obtenção de frequência
<p>Attendance to classes (according to General Evaluation Rules of FEUP) and execution of the scheduled practical assignment.</p>

## Melhoria de classificação
Only the exam component could be improved.
